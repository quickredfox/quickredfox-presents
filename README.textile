h1. Quickredfox Presents:

h2. A Javascript Compendium

bq. This pr√©cis aims to become a collection of great reusable self-contained mini-snippets in the artful language that is Javascript.

There are some conventions that I wish to impose on all items added to this collection, but if you just want to skip to a sample, try "the original":

h3. Comment Conventions ( draft 0.1 )

The preamble: 

<pre>
  /*
    Author: Author's Name
    Copyright: Copyright Notice (optional)
    License: License (optional)
    Source: http://athorshomepage.com/blog (optional)
    Description: 
    
        You can enter a description on a separate block
        as long as it's properly indented like here.
        
        A proper description is required!
        
    Example:
    (code)
        // In this block, you can also write lots a documentation 
        // but make sure you've read the size rules

        Stating.the("Obvious") // => "Duh!"
        
    (code)
  */
</pre>

h3. Containment Conventions ( draft 0.1 )

The safe-wrapper:
<pre>
  
  var Stating = (function(){
    // Do whatever you want here
    var S = {
      the: function(string){
        if (string.toLowerCase() == 'obvious')
          return 'Duh!'
        else
          return false;
      }
    }
    // Dont forget to return your whatever
    return S;
  })(); // important!
  
</pre>

h3. Size Rules and other tid-bits. ( draft 0.1 ) 

The size of each snippet should not be too complex and must not have dependencies such as other libraries unless they are included within the snippet somehow.

For those brief moments in life when we have no time to comment on the obivous, let us not do so but normally of course, provide proper indentation and commenting.
